# Module 5: Vision-Language-Action Integration

## Coming in Iteration 3

This module will cover Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and their application to humanoid robotics. Topics will include:

- **Vision-Language Models**: Understanding multimodal AI that processes both visual and textual information
- **VLA Architectures**: How VLA models enable robots to understand natural language commands and translate them into physical actions
- **Robot Task Execution**: Connecting high-level language instructions to low-level motor control
- **Real-World Applications**: Using VLA models for manipulation, navigation, and human-robot interaction

**Prerequisites**:
- Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence
- Module 2: ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System
- Module 3: Digital Twin – Gazebo & Unity Simulation
- Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac – AI Robot Brain

**Status**: Content development scheduled for Iteration 3 (hands-on implementation phase)

**For now, please complete Modules 1-4 to build the foundational knowledge required for VLA integration.**
