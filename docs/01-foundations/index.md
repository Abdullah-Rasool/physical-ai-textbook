## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** what Physical AI is and how it fundamentally differs from traditional AI systems
2. **Describe** the concept of embodied intelligence and the perception-action loop
3. **Articulate** why humanoid form factors are relevant for physical AI applications
4. **Visualize** the end-to-end system architecture connecting sensing, processing, and actuation in humanoid robots
5. **Identify** the key challenges that emerge when AI systems interact with the physical world

## Prerequisites

**Required Knowledge**:
- None (this is Module 1 - foundational concepts)

**Recommended Background**:
- Basic programming experience (Python examples will be used)
- Familiarity with fundamental computer science concepts (data structures, algorithms)
- Basic understanding of machine learning (helpful but not required)

## What You'll Learn

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional artificial intelligence that operates purely in the digital realm. This module establishes the conceptual foundation for understanding how intelligence emerges when AI systems are embodied in physical robots that sense and act in the real world.

### Module Overview

This module covers four core concepts:

1. **What is Physical AI?** - Understanding the fundamental difference between digital and physical intelligence
2. **Embodied Intelligence** - How physical embodiment shapes the nature of intelligence
3. **Humanoid Form Factor** - Why building human-shaped robots matters for AI
4. **End-to-End System Overview** - The complete pipeline from perception to action

### Why This Matters

Traditional AI systems process digital information—text, images, structured data—and produce digital outputs. Physical AI systems must deal with the messy, uncertain physical world: navigating spaces, manipulating objects, and interacting with humans. This fundamental difference requires new architectural approaches, new algorithms, and new ways of thinking about intelligence itself.

By the end of this module, you'll understand:
- How physical embodiment changes the AI problem fundamentally
- Why perception and action must be tightly coupled in physical systems
- The architectural components that enable humanoid robots to function
- How concepts from cognitive science inform Physical AI design

### Connection to Later Modules

This module sets the stage for:
- **Module 2 (ROS 2)**: Understanding the communication infrastructure needed for distributed physical systems
- **Module 3 (Digital Twin)**: Learning how simulation enables safe development of physical AI
- **Module 4 (Isaac)**: Exploring how GPU-accelerated AI powers real-time robot intelligence
