# Module 6: Capstone – Building a Humanoid AI System

## Coming in Iteration 3

This capstone module will guide you through building a complete end-to-end humanoid AI system, integrating all concepts from previous modules. Topics will include:

- **System Integration**: Connecting ROS 2, simulation, Isaac, and VLA into a cohesive humanoid robot system
- **Hardware Setup**: Configuring physical humanoid robot hardware (sensors, actuators, compute)
- **Deployment Pipeline**: From simulation to real-world deployment
- **Real-World Testing**: Safety protocols, performance benchmarking, and iterative improvement
- **Production Considerations**: Reliability, monitoring, and maintenance of deployed humanoid robots

**Prerequisites**:
- Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence
- Module 2: ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System
- Module 3: Digital Twin – Gazebo & Unity Simulation
- Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac – AI Robot Brain
- Module 5: Vision-Language-Action Integration

**Status**: Content development scheduled for Iteration 3 (hands-on implementation phase)
