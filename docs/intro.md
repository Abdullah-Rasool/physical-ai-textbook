# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the AI-native interactive textbook on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**!

## What You'll Learn

This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to building intelligent humanoid robots that can perceive, reason about, and act in the physical world. You'll learn:

- **Foundational Concepts**: What Physical AI is and how it differs from traditional AI
- **System Architecture**: How ROS 2, simulation, and AI tooling work together
- **Vision-Language-Action**: How modern VLA models enable language-driven robot control
- **Complete Integration**: Building end-to-end humanoid AI architectures

## Course Structure

The textbook is organized into 6 modules, progressing from foundational concepts to complete system architecture:

| Module | Title | Focus |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **1** | Foundations of Physical AI | Core concepts: embodiment, perception-action loops |
| **2** | ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System | Communication infrastructure for robotics |
| **3** | Digital Twin – Simulation | Safe development with Gazebo, Unity, sim-to-real |
| **4** | NVIDIA Isaac – AI Robot Brain | GPU-accelerated perception and AI inference |
| **5** | Vision-Language-Action Integration | VLA models: language to robot action |
| **6** | Capstone: End-to-End Architecture | Complete humanoid AI system design |

## Current Status: Iteration 3 Complete

All six modules are now available, providing **conceptual mastery** of humanoid AI systems:

- **Modules 1-4**: Physical AI foundations, ROS 2, simulation, and GPU-accelerated perception
- **Module 5**: Vision-Language-Action models—the intelligence layer enabling language-driven robot behavior
- **Module 6**: Capstone synthesis—how all components connect into complete humanoid AI architecture

**Next iterations** will add hands-on tutorials, production deployment guides, and advanced topics including robot learning with Isaac Lab.

## Who This Is For

This textbook is designed for:

- **Computer Science Students** with interest in robotics and AI
- **Robotics Engineers** looking to integrate AI into physical systems
- **AI Practitioners** wanting to apply machine learning to embodied agents
- **Researchers** exploring the intersection of AI and physical intelligence

## Prerequisites

- **Programming**: Familiarity with Python (code examples use Python)
- **Mathematics**: Basic linear algebra and probability
- **Computer Science**: Data structures, algorithms, and software engineering fundamentals
- **Machine Learning** (helpful but not required): Basic understanding of neural networks

## How to Use This Textbook

1. **Read sequentially**: Modules build on each other conceptually
2. **Follow the diagrams**: Text-described architecture diagrams illustrate system design
3. **Understand connections**: Each module references prior concepts—follow the cross-references
4. **Complete each module**: Aim for 30-40 minutes of focused reading per module
5. **Synthesize in Module 6**: The Capstone module ties everything together

## Learning Outcomes

After completing all six modules, you will be able to:

- **Explain** how humanoid AI systems perceive, reason, and act
- **Describe** the role of each architectural layer (perception, communication, intelligence, control)
- **Trace** data flow from human language command through system to robot action
- **Compare** VLA architectural approaches and articulate tradeoffs
- **Design** (conceptually) end-to-end humanoid AI architectures

## Let's Begin!

Start with **[Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence](./01-foundations/index.md)** to build your conceptual foundation for humanoid AI systems.
