# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the AI-native interactive textbook on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**!

## What You'll Learn

This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to building intelligent humanoid robots that can perceive, reason about, and act in the physical world. You'll learn:

- **Foundational Concepts**: What Physical AI is and how it differs from traditional AI
- **System Architecture**: How ROS 2, simulation, and AI tooling work together
- **Practical Integration**: Connecting perception, planning, and action in robotic systems
- **Real-World Applications**: Building humanoid robots that interact with the physical environment

## Course Structure

The textbook is organized into 6 modules, progressing from foundational concepts to hands-on implementation:

1. **Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence** - Core concepts and theory
2. **ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System** - Communication and system integration
3. **Digital Twin – Gazebo & Unity Simulation** - Safe development and testing
4. **NVIDIA Isaac – AI Robot Brain** - AI-powered perception and control
5. **Vision-Language-Action Integration** (Iteration 3) - Multimodal AI for robots
6. **Capstone: Building a Humanoid AI System** (Iteration 3) - End-to-end implementation

## Current Status: Iteration 2

**Modules 1-4** are currently available, providing conceptual mastery of Physical AI fundamentals. **Modules 5-6** will be added in Iteration 3 with hands-on tutorials and production-grade implementations.

## Who This Is For

This textbook is designed for:

- **Computer Science Students** with interest in robotics and AI
- **Robotics Engineers** looking to integrate AI into physical systems
- **AI Practitioners** wanting to apply machine learning to embodied agents
- **Researchers** exploring the intersection of AI and physical intelligence

## Prerequisites

- **Programming**: Familiarity with Python (code examples use Python)
- **Mathematics**: Basic linear algebra and probability
- **Computer Science**: Data structures, algorithms, and software engineering fundamentals
- **Machine Learning** (helpful but not required): Basic understanding of neural networks

## How to Use This Textbook

1. **Read sequentially**: Modules build on each other conceptually
2. **Follow the code examples**: Illustrative snippets demonstrate key concepts
3. **Visualize architectures**: Text-described diagrams help you understand system design
4. **Complete each module**: Aim for 20-40 minutes of focused reading per module
5. **Progress to advanced topics**: Iteration 3 will provide hands-on implementation

## Let's Begin!

Start with **Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence** to build your understanding of what makes Physical AI unique.
